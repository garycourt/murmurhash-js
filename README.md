# MurmurHash.js

All credit for implementation the hashing function goes to  Gary Court's. I just added an export statement for ECMAScript 6 compatibility.

An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms.

These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance.

More information about these algorithms can be found at:
